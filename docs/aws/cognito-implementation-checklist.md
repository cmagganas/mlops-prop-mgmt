# AWS Cognito Implementation Checklist

## Current State Assessment

### Backend (FastAPI)

‚úÖ **What's Working**:
- FastAPI application structure is in place following proper practices with router separation
- Basic endpoints are available, including health check
- Cognito integration code is implemented with support for the authorization flow
- Configuration via environment variables is properly set up
- The auth diagnostic endpoint shows successful connections to Cognito
- Cognito domain format has been fixed to follow the proper pattern
- Login URL generation is working properly with redirect to Cognito hosted UI
- Complete authentication flow working end-to-end with token exchange and user data retrieval

‚ö†Ô∏è **Issues**:
- The Cognito authentication flow is not yet tested end-to-end

### Frontend

‚úÖ **What's Working**:
- Basic React application structure is in place
- Authentication components are implemented
- AWS Amplify is configured for Cognito integration
- Frontend dependencies are now installed correctly
- Frontend configuration now matches backend Cognito settings
- Authentication state correctly displayed in UI
- Login and logout flows both working correctly

‚ö†Ô∏è **Issues**:
- The authentication flow is not yet tested end-to-end in the frontend

### AWS Cognito Configuration

‚úÖ **What's Working**:
- The JWKS endpoint is accessible and returns valid data
- Domain DNS resolves correctly
- Login URL generation works and points to a properly formatted Cognito domain
- Frontend and backend configurations are now aligned
- App client callback URLs and sign-out URLs properly configured
- Complete authentication flow verified end-to-end

‚ö†Ô∏è **Issues**:
- AWS CLI access is not available, making direct verification of Cognito resources impossible
- Full end-to-end authentication flow not yet verified

## Fix Checklist

### 1. Fix Frontend Dependencies First

- [x] **1.1 Install Frontend Dependencies**
  - Task: Install missing npm dependencies
  - Command: `cd frontend && npm install`
  - Test: Command completes without error

- [x] **1.2 Verify React Scripts Installation**
  - Task: Check if react-scripts is installed
  - Command: `cd frontend && npx react-scripts --version`
  - Test: react-scripts is present in package.json with version 5.0.1

### 2. Fix Backend Cognito Configuration

- [x] **2.1 Update Backend .env File with Correct Cognito Domain Format**
  - Task: Edit `backend/.env` file to use proper Cognito domain format
  - Format should be: `<domain-prefix>.auth.<region>.amazoncognito.com`
  - Test: File updated and changes saved

- [x] **2.2 Validate Backend Configuration**
  - Task: Start the backend server and check configuration
  - Command: `cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload`
  - Test: Access `http://localhost:8000/auth/diagnostic` to verify correct domain format

- [x] **2.3 Test Backend Auth Endpoints**
  - Task: Test the authentication test endpoint
  - Command: `curl http://localhost:8000/auth/test`
  - Test: Response indicates success with valid configuration

### 3. Align Frontend and Backend Cognito Configuration

- [x] **3.1 Update Frontend Configuration to Match Backend**
  - Task: Edit `frontend/src/config.ts` to use the same Cognito settings as backend
  - Update client ID, domain, and other settings to match backend
  - Test: File updated and changes saved

- [x] **3.2 Create/Update Frontend .env File**
  - Task: Create or update a `.env` file in the frontend directory with correct settings
  - Example: `REACT_APP_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID=50m5rakpde2qse9mf8pb9c12bb`
  - Test: File created/updated with correct settings

- [x] **3.3 Start Frontend Application**
  - Task: Start the frontend application
  - Command: `cd frontend && npm start`
  - Test: Application starts successfully without errors

### 4. Verify Cognito Configuration Through Application

- [x] **4.1 Examine Backend Diagnostic Endpoints**
  - Task: Use backend diagnostic endpoints to verify Cognito settings
  - Command: `curl http://localhost:8000/auth/diagnostic`
  - Test: Response shows properly configured Cognito settings with correct domain format

- [x] **4.2 Test Backend Login URL Generation**
  - Task: Check the login URL generation
  - Command: `curl -v http://localhost:8000/auth/login`
  - Test: Response redirects to a valid Cognito hosted UI URL

- [x] **4.3 Check JWKS Endpoint Accessibility**
  - Task: Verify JWKS endpoint is accessible
  - Command: Response from diagnostic endpoint shows JWKS endpoint is accessible
  - Test: Endpoint returns JWKS data without error

### 5. Test the Authentication Flow End-to-End

- [x] **5.1 Test Login Redirect**
  - Task: Access the frontend application and click login
  - Test: Browser redirects to Cognito hosted UI login page

- [x] **5.2 Test Authentication Callback**
  - Task: Complete login in Cognito hosted UI
  - Test: Browser redirects back to application with authentication code

- [x] **5.3 Verify Token Exchange**
  - Task: Check browser cookies for ID token after successful login
  - Test: HttpOnly cookie named `id_token` is set in browser

- [x] **5.4 Test Protected Resource Access**
  - Task: Access a protected resource in the application
  - Test: Resource is accessible with valid authentication

### 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- [x] **6.1 Check for CORS Issues**
  - Task: Check browser console for CORS errors
  - Test: No CORS errors in browser console

- [x] **6.2 Verify Token Validation**
  - Task: Test token validation by accessing `/auth/user` endpoint
  - Command: `curl -v --cookie "id_token=<actual-token>" http://localhost:8000/auth/user`
  - Test: Endpoint returns user information without error

## Implementation Strategy

1. Follow this checklist step by step - DO NOT skip steps or work on multiple steps simultaneously
2. Document results of each step, especially any errors or unexpected behavior
3. After completing each section, validate the entire section works as expected before moving to the next
4. If you encounter issues, stop and troubleshoot before proceeding

Remember: The goal is to fix one thing at a time and ensure each component is working correctly before integrating them together.

## Note on AWS CLI Access

Direct verification of AWS Cognito resources via AWS CLI is not possible due to authentication issues with the configured AWS credentials. We will focus on verifying and fixing the Cognito configuration through the application itself.

## Progress Summary

‚úÖ We have successfully:
1. Fixed the frontend dependencies
2. Fixed the backend Cognito configuration with the correct domain format
3. Aligned the frontend and backend Cognito configurations
4. Verified that the basic Cognito endpoints are accessible
5. Implemented and tested the complete end-to-end authentication flow
6. Verified user authentication state is correctly displayed in the UI
7. Tested protected resource access with the authenticated user

üéâ **COMPLETE**: The AWS Cognito implementation is now fully functional!
