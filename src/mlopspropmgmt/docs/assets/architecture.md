# Property Management System Architecture

## System Overview

The Property Management System is a cloud-based platform designed to streamline key property management functions. The system follows a modern microservices architecture with a FastAPI backend, leveraging AWS services for deployment and operations.

## Core Components

### 1. FastAPI Service

The FastAPI service is the central component responsible for processing API requests, implementing business logic, and interacting with databases and other services.

Key features:
- **Asynchronous request handling**: Uses FastAPI's built-in async capabilities for high performance
- **API routing**: Organizes endpoints logically by domain (properties, tenants, payments)
- **Data validation**: Utilizes Pydantic models for request and response validation
- **Database interactions**: Uses SQLAlchemy for database operations

### 2. Database Layer

The system uses a relational database to store structured data about properties, units, tenants, leases, and payments.

Key entities:
- **Properties**: Represents real estate properties
- **Units**: Individual rentable units within properties
- **Tenants**: Individuals or organizations renting units
- **Leases**: Legal agreements between tenants and property owners
- **Payments**: Financial transactions related to leases

### 3. Authentication and Authorization

User authentication is handled via AWS Cognito, providing:
- **Secure user authentication**: Using industry standard protocols
- **Role-based access control**: Different permissions for property managers, owners, and maintenance staff
- **JWT token validation**: Secured API access

### 4. File Storage

AWS S3 is used for storing various documents and images:
- **Receipt images**: For expense tracking
- **Property photos**: For documentation and listings
- **Lease documents**: For legal record-keeping

## Data Flow

1. **User authentication**:
   - User logs in through Cognito
   - JWT token is issued and stored in the browser
   - Subsequent requests include this token for authorization

2. **API requests**:
   - Client makes HTTPS requests to API Gateway
   - API Gateway validates requests and forwards to FastAPI service
   - FastAPI service processes requests, interacts with database, and returns responses

3. **File operations**:
   - For file uploads, the API service generates pre-signed S3 URLs
   - Client uploads directly to S3 using these URLs
   - For file downloads, the process is reversed

## Security Considerations

- All API endpoints are secured using JWT tokens
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Database credentials and connection strings are stored securely using environment variables
- API Gateway provides additional request filtering and rate limiting

## Performance Considerations

- FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities enable high throughput
- Database queries are optimized for performance
- Pagination is implemented for endpoints returning large datasets
- AWS services auto-scale based on demand

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-time notifications**: Implementing WebSocket connections for instant updates
- **Data analytics**: Adding a data warehouse for advanced reporting
- **Mobile app integration**: Developing a dedicated mobile client
- **Maintenance ticketing system**: Enhancing the current maintenance request functionality
