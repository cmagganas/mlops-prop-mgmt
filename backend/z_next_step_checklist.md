# Next Steps Checklist

## Package and Deploy
- [x] Fix incompatible package versions
  - [x] Used compatible versions: FastAPI 0.95.2, Pydantic 1.10.8, Starlette 0.27.0
- [x] Simplify the application structure
  - [x] Removed excess code and consolidated deployment approach
  - [x] Streamlined app structure for easier maintenance
- [x] Verify Lambda deployment with API Gateway integration
  - [x] Successfully packaged the application with required dependencies

## Deployment Notes
- Use the `package-lambda.sh` approach for future deployments
- Remember to update environment variables for different environments
- Current lambda_pkg.zip includes all necessary dependencies for the FastAPI application
